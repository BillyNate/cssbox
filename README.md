#CSSBox

####CSSbox is a pure css lightbox, no JavaScript needed.

Currently __CSSBox is in Beta__. Improvements made to CSSBox will not necessarily be backward compatible until version 1.0 is reached.

The idea to make a pure css lightbox came to mind when reading the [A List Apart article about radio-controlled web design](http://alistapart.com/article/radio-controlled-web-design).
CSSBox is not the first though, as a quick Google search shows us [Futurebox](http://www.thecssninja.com/demo/futurebox/v3/) and [Jesse Couch's PoC](http://www.designcouch.com/demos/responsive-css3-lightbox.html).
Unfortunately these lightboxes have their large images loaded on page load, which increases the loading times (and bandwidth usage) even though visitors may or may not open the lightbox.
Also you'll have to do all the dirty work yourself instead of only implementing a library.
CSSbox fill this void.
